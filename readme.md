# Trail-Route
## Introduction
  <p>This web map was to introduce us into the world of web mapping and to test our ability as we learn the basics of coding using markdown language. I decided to create mine on familiar territory of somewhere I have been, which was the Mill Creek area. Using GeoJson I was able to map out the route from a landmark such as Andrews Geyser all the was to Ridgecrest Conference Center. </p>
  
  ## Major Functions
   <p>The functions of this project are; An interactive world map with 4 informative landmarks, A detailed route that is highlighted, zoom functions across the entire map, and a description of the focused area.  </p> 

   ## Libraries
   <p> Libraries used include, Leaflet for implementing the interactive basemap, VS Studio for writing the code for the route placement and map details, and jQuery for code needed to implement aspects of the web map. </p>

   ## Data Sources
   <p> Data sources include Google maps for route planning and coordinate information, GeoJson for planning the route and detailed coordinate location, Destination McDowell for information on the Mill Creek area, and FUGEcamps for information on Ridgecrest conference center</p>
